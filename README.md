 Written using the JavaFx library. 
<h2> Functional capabilities:</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Draw a graph (oriented, undirected, mixed, weighted), with the ability to change colors, sizes of vertices and edges;</li>
 <li>Change of curvature, weights, name, orientation of graph edges; </li>
 <li>Output the incidence and adjacency matrix of the graph drawn or generated from the input data; </li>
 <li>Create a graph based on the input data: a text file with an incidence or adjacency matrix, a set of edges and a number of vertices with the ability to dynamically change the orientation of the graph; </li>
 <li>Implement algorithms on graphs (Dijkstra's algorithm, width and depth traversal of the graph); </li>
 <li>Export the graph as a file with its own extension and as a png file. </li>
 </ul>
